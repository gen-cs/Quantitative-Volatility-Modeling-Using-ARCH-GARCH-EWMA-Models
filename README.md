• Developed and compared three volatility forecasting models—ARCH (Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroskedasticity), GARCH (Generalized ARCH), and EWMA
(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)—to capture time-varying volatility in
financial return series.

• Calibrated models using historical daily return data, to generate forward-looking
volatility estimates. Compared predicted volatility from each model with realized (actual)
volatility.
